# Mad Forms

Mad Forms is a WYSIWYG form builder that lets you build fill-in-the-blank sentences that are submitted as a form.
I worked on this project in 2011, and it's fun to see that it still works.
Check out [madforms.com](https://madforms.com) and play with the form builder.

Here's what it looks like. Not too bad for 2011, if I say so myself!
